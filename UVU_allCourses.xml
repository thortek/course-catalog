<description>Focuses on the biological and contextual study of human remains recovered from archaeological sites. Presents an updated synthesis of bio-archaeological science dealing with the study of the human skeleton to reconstruct patterns of biological stress, infectious disease, lifestyle and physical activity, diet, violent death, and genetic relationships in the past. Temporal coverage principally falls on the last 10,000 years of history, and the spatial scope is global. Involves the dynamic nature of skeletal tissues and the influences of environment and culture on human variation. Acquired skills will be of value to any students interested in skeletal studies including archaeology, bioarchaeology, paleopathology, forensic science, vertebrate biology, biomedical sciences, and behavioral science.</description>

<description>Provides teachers with a deep and useful understanding of force and the nature of how students use concepts of force to make sense of phenomena across life, earth, and physical science. Explores the theory of and enhances teacher insights into: 1) how force, matter and energy interact, 2) the relationship of force to energy and interactions within fields, and 3) pedagogical content knowledge around teaching and learning about force. Also connects knowledge of concepts of force to practices in technology, engineering and mathematics, and engages participants in evaluating technology appropriate to elementary STEM instruction. Requires participants to make connections between current learning theories and methods of STEM instruction.</description>

Teaches how to improve authentic pronunciation, reduce errors in authenticity of language structure, generate thought in the target language spontaneously as a substitute for translation, and sharpen listening comprehension for natural conversational flow. Contrasts with all other first year courses which must strive to produce mastery of the whole range of language acquisition components, including writing, grammar, etc. Facilitates lowering the affective filter when conversing in the target language by increasing the frequency of speech opportunities and defusing concern for such matters as spelling, etc. Increases mastery of lexical items through increased frequency of oral usage.

<description>Explores Humanism or Posthumanism across the arts and their diverse cultural history. Defines humanism as varieties of the traditional view that Man is the measure of all things, and Posthumanism as an umbrella term for recent theoretical approaches within the humanities that challenge this view, for instance by placing humanity in the context of global or universal, intrinsically diverse and self-generating, scientific, technological, or ecological systems. May compare aspects of humanism throughout space and time, in its diverse cultural manifestations, or may focus on a twenty-first-century view of these long traditions. May also choose the example of the humanistic or posthumanistic aspects of a single time period, culture, or interdisciplinary oeuvre. Offers an opportunity to advanced students to synthesize, critique, and strengthen their own viewpoints, and to expand their interdisciplinary understanding of human expression, in response to the most fundamental or recent currents within intellectual history.

<description>Offers novice Spanish speakers opportunities to enhance their speaking proficiency in the target language by focusing on oral verbal production. Teaches how to improve authentic pronunciation, reduce errors in authenticity of language structure, generate thought in the target language spontaneously as a substitute for translation, and sharpen listening comprehension for natural conversational flow. Contrasts with all other first year courses which must strive to produce mastery of the whole range of language acquisition components, including writing, grammar, etc. Facilitates lowering the affective filter when conversing in the target language by increasing the frequency of speech opportunities and defusing concern for such matters as spelling, etc. Increases mastery of lexical items through increased frequency of oral usage. May be repeated for a maximum of 3 credits toward graduation.</description>
